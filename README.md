# killtasks
## About
Given a .txt file in the same directory as killproc.exe, this short program will kill the processes as if a user is doing so in Task Manager. Good for killing a pre-known set of annoying processes or a number of proceeses that may be hard to kill (*ahem* Intellij for me at least).
